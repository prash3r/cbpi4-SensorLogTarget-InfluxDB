# CraftBeerPi4 Plugin to log sensor data to InfluxDB

**UNTESTED**

This plugin exports the existing InfluxDB integration to a plugin. The intend is to remove InfluxDB functionality from the main project and provide it with this plugin instead.

This plugin currently only works with the branch prash3r/hookable-log-data and is not functional with any version upstream.
